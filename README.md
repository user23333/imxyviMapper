# imxyviMapper
Based on physmeme. https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/anti-cheat-bypass/388653-physmeme.html

The mapper has been updated for current windows 10 and 11 versions,imxyviMapper uses a different vulnerable driver ( AsUpIO.sys ) and the code has been adjusted in order to communicate with it.

You need a driver with a custom entrypoint and disable GS Security check.
